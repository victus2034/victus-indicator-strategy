"""Forward paper trading against live prices, with no broker and no money.

The daily backtest replays history through the same logic that produced the
alerts, so it can only ever be in-sample. This module runs the same trade
rules forward in real time instead: it opens a virtual position only when
live price actually reaches the alert's recorded entry, carries it under the
locked stop, and squares off at 15:10 like the user does. Comparing its
results against the backtest's for the same day is therefore a genuinely
out-of-sample check on both the edge and the fill assumptions.

Deliberately reuses daily_backtest_summary's constants and
entry_confirm's watch-window logic rather than re-deriving them, so any
divergence in the report reflects reality and not two drifting copies of
the same rules.

  --tick    advance the simulation (schedule this through the session)
