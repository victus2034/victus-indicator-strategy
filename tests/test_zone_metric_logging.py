"""The zone-quality metrics must survive the whole way to the analysis.

Every one of these fields was computed by the scanners and then dropped
before anything could learn from it: the crypto scanner never wrote them,
and the backtest never carried the NSE copies past load_records. Both gaps
were silent, because a missing key just reads as null.
