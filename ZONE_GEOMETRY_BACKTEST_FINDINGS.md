# Should Victus move to v7's zone geometry? — Not on this evidence, but it is closer than the first run said.

Run 2026-09-05 with `zone_geometry_backtest.py` (removed 2026-10-02; still in git history). 42 crypto symbols, 30m, up to
3,000 bars each (~62 days), one identical trade simulator across all four arms.

## Result

```

`atr` is production today. `wick0` is the pivot candle's own wick — the version
already reverted. `wick5` is v7's geometry (near edge = closest close within ±5
bars). `v7full` adds v7's other three changes: wick-break, touch-restarting
freshness clock, weakest-first eviction.

NET is after the 0.10% crypto round trip and 0.05% stop slippage that
`daily_backtest_summary` uses. Everything else — pivots, ATR, overlap filter,
history depth, age gate, over-touch veto, entry, stop, exit — is held constant,
so a difference between rows is attributable to what the arm name says.

**The current geometry wins gross and net. v7's geometry is the weakest arm on
net expectancy.**

## The prediction that failed

Before running this I argued that the earlier wick revert failed because
`pine_wick_zones_experimental.pine` (removed 2026-10-09; in git history) used `base_extra = 0`, and that v7's ±5
window would fix it. That was wrong in the way that matters:

* `wick5` vs `wick0` on win rate: **66.4% vs 66.4%** — identical.
* On net expectancy `wick5` is **worse** (0.015 vs 0.036).
* The ±5 window tightened the median stop only 0.60% → 0.55%.

Matching the shape Shiva draws by hand did not improve the alerts. Zone *shape*
and alert *edge* are separate claims and I had been treating them as one.

## The caveat that cuts the other way

`atr`'s lead is not robust to how unresolvable bars are treated. It produces the
most of them — 151 of 886, 17%, versus 40 for `v7full` — because a 0.35% stop and
a 0.35% target both sit inside a single 30m candle far more often.

```
arm       amb  net R (amb=0)  net R (amb=loss)  net R (amb=win)
atr       151          0.051            -0.119            0.222
wick0      88          0.036            -0.062            0.135
wick5     104          0.015            -0.099            0.129
v7full     40          0.039            -0.024            0.102
```

Score every ambiguous bar as a loss and `atr` becomes the **worst** arm and
`v7full` the best. The headline ranking holds only under the neutral and
favourable readings. That is a genuine weakness in the evidence, not a reason to
switch — nothing here makes a case *for* v7 either.

## The finding worth more than the question asked

Costs eat **83–95% of gross edge on every arm**:

```
atr      gross 0.374 -> net 0.051   86% eaten
wick0    gross 0.288 -> net 0.036   87% eaten
wick5    gross 0.284 -> net 0.015   95% eaten
v7full   gross 0.232 -> net 0.039   83% eaten
```

At a 0.35% median stop the round trip alone is **0.29R per trade**. Stop width is
a far bigger lever on net outcome than zone geometry, and `daily_backtest_summary`
already says so in its own comment at line 1269. Widening stops, or targeting
beyond 1R, is where the return on effort is — not in redrawing boxes.

## Decision

**Keep the ATR band in the scanner. v7 stays the chart indicator.**

Two things from v7 are worth porting on their own merits, independent of
geometry, because they are bug fixes rather than changes of opinion:

1. `zones[:] = zones[-HISTORY_OF_ZONES_TO_KEEP:]` in `build_zones` drops the
   **oldest** zone when full — the same FIFO fault v7 fixed. It throws away
   exactly the old untouched zones the strategy says are strongest.
2. The freshness clock (`too_young_to_alert`) measures from `created_idx` only
   and never restarts on a touch, so a zone that price keeps working can still
   qualify once it is old enough.

Neither changes zone shape. Both could be tested with this same harness.

## Limits of this test

* In-sample; every arm scored on the history that shaped it.
* 30m only. `config.TIMEFRAME` is 4h and 4h was **not** tested.
* Bar-resolution fills; same-bar stop+target recorded as ambiguous, not guessed.
* One venue (kucoinfutures), not the live scanner's venue routing.
* Fixed 1R target and 24-bar hold — simpler than the live exit rules, so absolute
  numbers are not live P&L. The comparison between arms is the usable part.
* The `atr` arm was verified to reproduce `scanner.qualify_wick_zone` exactly
  (77 zones on BTC, zero mismatches) before any of this was run.

## Reproducing

```bash
python zone_geometry_backtest.py --bars 3000 --symbols 45 --timeframe 30m
```

Writes `zone_geometry_backtest_results_net.json`. Imports `scanner` and `config`
read-only; touches nothing in the live alert path.

# Revision, 2026-09-06

Two things were wrong with the run above.

**1. It scored a buggy v7.** `Shiva_Indicator_v7.pine` used `close` for the zone's
near edge where it should use the body edge, `math.max/min(open, close)`. A wick
ends at the body. Close alone is right only when the pivot candle points the
helpful way, and every reference example coincided except EX1 — a supply pivot on
a red candle, where close sat 368 points below the drawn box. Fixed in the Pine and
added here as the `wick5_close` arm so the cost of the bug is a number.

**2. 62 days could not exercise the eviction fix.** The first harness also dropped
broken zones from its list, while production keeps them (`zones[-60:]`), so the
cap was never reached. Harness now mirrors production, and the run is 187 days.

## Result — 42 symbols, 30m, up to 9,000 bars

```

```

## Fix 1 — drop the weakest zone, not the oldest: real, but immaterial

Eviction fires and picks a different victim **100% of the time**, yet the result
barely moves: 1213 -> 1212 trades, 65.2 -> 65.6 total net R. The zones it drops are
already spent, so neither choice would have produced a trade. Port it as a
correctness fix — it is what makes old untouched zones survive on the chart — but
expect no P&L change.

## Fix 2 — freshness clock restarts on every touch: a small, consistent win

Net expectancy 0.054 -> 0.058 (+7%), win rate 72.7% -> 72.9%, and it gets there by
**removing** 56 trades rather than adding any. Median age at entry rises 50 -> 53
bars. Held at both 62 and 187 days. Port it.

## Geometry — the answer weakened

`v7full` is now **level with the ATR band on net expectancy** (0.055 vs 0.054) and
it is far more robust, because it does not depend on the one assumption this test
cannot check:

```
arm          trades   amb%  net(amb=0)  net(amb=loss)  net(amb=win)
atr            1213   17.4       0.054         -0.120         0.228
atr_clock      1157   17.9       0.058         -0.121         0.237
wick5          1232   13.6       0.014         -0.123         0.150
v7full          855    7.6       0.055         -0.021         0.131
```

`atr` resolves 17.4% of its trades inside a single candle where the stop and the
target both sit — a 0.35% stop against a 0.35% target. Those are scored neutral and
cannot be checked at bar resolution. `v7full` has 7.6%, less than half, because its
stop is nearly twice as wide.

Score the collisions as losses and `v7full` is the only arm anywhere near break
even (-0.021 against -0.120). Score them neutral or favourably and the ATR family
wins on volume: 1,156 trades for 67.5 total R against 855 for 46.7.

Note the geometry alone is not what does this. `wick5` on its own is the weakest
arm at 0.014. `v7full`'s standing comes from the **wick break rule** killing zones
earlier, plus the freshness clock — not from the box shape.

## Revised decision

* **Port the freshness clock restart.** Small, consistent, free, no geometry change.
* **Port the weakest-first eviction** as a correctness fix, expecting no P&L effect.
* **Leave the geometry alone for now** — but "v7 is worse" is no longer supported.
  It is level per trade, lower in volume, and materially more robust. The way to
  settle that is `paper_trading.py` forward and out-of-sample, not another backtest
  of the same history.
* Costs still eat 83-95% of gross edge everywhere. Stop width remains the biggest
  lever in this system, ahead of any of the above.
