"""Stage pings for zone alerts that were already delivered.

Watches only zones that a real scanner alert already announced, and
reports how price is behaving relative to that alert's own recorded
entry and stop. It never re-derives levels, never scans for new
candidates, and never writes to the alert records the backtest reads.

Stages (one ping each, forward-only):
  1 GET READY     price within APPROACH_THRESHOLD_PCT of entry, entry
                  not yet reached
  2 ENTRY NOW     entry reached, under NEAR_SL_FRACTION of planned risk
                  consumed
  3 LATE/NEAR SL  entry reached, most of the planned risk already gone

Deliberately silent when the trade is no longer worth taking: price has
bounced back past entry into profit (entering now would sit far from the
locked stop), or the stop is already hit.

Every ping from one run goes out as a single digest. Posted one message
per symbol, a busy run buried the channel under dozens of separate blocks
and the few that mattered were impossible to pick out.
