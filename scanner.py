    the "candle end" - so the box still sits on something real rather than being

    That last step used to take the tightest candle level that existed, however
    wide it left the zone, and cut at the limit only when the window offered no
    level between the two edges at all. On a spike wick there is almost always
    SOME level in between and it is nowhere near the limit, so the rescue fired,
    moved the edge a little, and handed back a zone as untradeable as the one it
    was given: 14% of live zones came out over the limit, the worst at 19.6%,
    each one alerting with a stop the size of the move it was meant to catch.
    Cutting is a synthetic edge, which is why it is the last resort - but a
