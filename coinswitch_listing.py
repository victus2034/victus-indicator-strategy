A symbol CoinSwitch does not list is not an error you would ever see: the

you are not charting. This asks CoinSwitch for its instrument list once and
names every watchlist symbol that is missing from it.

With --discover it also ranks the contracts the watchlist does not hold by
24h volume, so symbols worth adding surface the same way thin ones do.
